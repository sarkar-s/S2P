Stochastic Simulation for Photopolymerization

This software simulates the stochastic growth of a polymer network due to reaction-diffusion. 
The Bond Fluctuation Model is used to represent the growing polymer network.
The Gillespie algorithm is used to simulate the intiation, chain growth, cross-linking, and fluctuation steps.

Documentation file describes the layout of the input file, and a demonstrative example is in the folder Example.
