Stochastic Simulation for Photopolymerization

This software simulates the stochastic growth of a polymer network due to reaction-diffusion. 
The Bond Fluctuation Model is used to represent the growing polymer network.
The Gillespie algorithm is used to simulate the intiation, chain growth, cross-linking, and fluctuation steps.
Documentation to use is available at ( https://www.nist.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2018/02/02/documentation_5.pdf )

A running example is in the folder Example.
