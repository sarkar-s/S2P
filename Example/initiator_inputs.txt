# This file contains the specifics of the initiator/co-initiator system

Initiation type (unimolecular or bimolecular) = unimolecular
Percentage of initiators (mole fraction) = 0.01

# The following inputs are only for a bimolecular initiation system
Percentage of co-initiators (mole fraction) = 1.0
Initiator volume (in A^3) = 100
Co-initiator volume (in A^3) = 100
Initiator surface area (in A^2) = 100
Co-initiator surface area (in A^2) = 100
Initiator molecular weight = 100
Co-initiator molecular weight = 100
Excitation lifetime of the initiator = 1E-6
